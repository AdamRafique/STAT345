#The following code retrieves the locations of shots made by Milwaukee Bucks players by year and puts each into its own separate dataframe. teams_shots("Bucks", seasons = 20XX) retrieves the shot data for the Bucks for that particular year, filter(isShotMade == TRUE) removes the shots that were missed, select(locationX, locationY) makes sure the dataframe only includes the X-coordinate and Y-coordinate of where the shot was made ((0, 0) being the center of the net).
